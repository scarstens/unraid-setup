# Seths guide to setting up your UNRAID server
After working with unraid for several years, I decided its time I documented things I learned and how my current setup works. While I do intend for this guide to help others, honestly, I'm doing this documentation just as much for my own purposes, as I have trouble remembering all the tricks I used in the setup process. My current setup is fantastic, requires almost no maintanance, and the system maintains great uptimes:

## Downloading and Installing the OS

- I highly recommend you just purchase the prebuilt flash drive from limetech to avoid any setup issues:

## Setup Deluge Torrent with VPN for Security
This setup assumes you are going to pay for privateinternetaccess.com to protect your privacy while using a torrent provider, and that your local network is setup to DHCP addresses like '192.168.2.1`. Note that deluge is more reliable then transmission, utorrent or rtorrent when you are using the UNRAID, Docker and related media providers (like couchpotato, sonarr, sickbeard, etc). 

- Signup and pay for account at privateinternetaccess.com
- From unraid web GUI -> docker -> search `binhex-delugevpn` and install
- Click `advanced` toggle in unraid ui (top right) 

![unraid-docker-advanced-view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scarstens/unraid-setup/master/assets/unraid-docker-advanced-view.png "unraid-docker-advanced-view")

- Change the ENV parameters as follows:
    - create `LAN_NETWORK` = `192.168.2.1/0`
    - edit `VPN_USER` = [GetFromPIA](privateinternetaccess.com?refer=sethcarstens)
    - edit `VPN_PASS` = [GetFromPIA](privateinternetaccess.com?refer=sethcarstens)
    - edit `ENABLE_PRIVOXY` = `yes`
    - edit `LAN_RANGE` = `192.168.2.1-192.168.2.254`
- manually add new deluge client user and password so other docker containers can authenticate (http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/UserGuide/ThinClient#AddUsertotheauthenticationfile) I did this by `ssh` into the box and then editing the auth file, paths may vary depending on your config, mine looked like this `sudo nano /mnt/cache/appdata/binhex-deluge-vpn/auth` which opens the file for edit, then you just add `deluge:deluge:10` which will allow all docker apps on your server to authentication with deluge via the username `deluge` and the password `deluge`
- Stop and then Start the deluge docker
